vi ~/.ssh/knownhosts

/etc/ssh/sshd_config

To ssh to load balanced appliance:
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null {host}

StricthostKeyChecking=no will ignore if a key matches or not
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null will send all new entries into dev null to prevent new entries from entering conflict
