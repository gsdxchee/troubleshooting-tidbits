If presented with only 32 bit guest versions but the host is a 64 bit OS:

Virtualization Technologies (VTs) and Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VTd) Feature in the BIOS need to be enabled.

If this does not work (not tested):
turn windows features on or off
Hyper-V
This option might be conflicting with other Virtualization technology, disable this.


Things to confirm:
BIOS (VTs and VTd)
OS is 64-bit
