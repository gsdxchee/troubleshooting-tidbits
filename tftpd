Default /etc/xinetd.d/tftp:

service tftp
{
protocol = udp
port = 69
socket_type = dgram
wait = yes
user = nobody
server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args = /var/lib/tftpboot
disable = no
}

To help troubleshoot:
tftp> connect I.P.A.D
tftp> get FILE
(to help with troubleshooting, FILE can exist or not exist, result should be instant)

If it times out, try to reset tftpd on server:
service xinetd restart

Some log entries of activities might be found in:
/var/log/messages
