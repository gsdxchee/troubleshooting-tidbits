If during yum update, connection is lost, transactions could still be in queue.

If you connect again and perform the yum update again, both versions will exist on the server (verifiable by rpm -qa | grep {PKGNAME}, yum history info {NUM}, one will show installed and the other @)

yum install yum-utils
yum-complete-transaction


Installing older kernels:
yum install kernel-<version>-<revision>-<arch>
Eg: yum install kernel-2.6.504-8.1.el6
